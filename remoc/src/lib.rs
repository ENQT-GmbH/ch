//! Remoc ðŸ¦‘ â€” Remote multiplexed objects and channels
//!
//! # Physical transport
//!
//! All functionality in Remoc requires that a connection over a physical
//! transport is established.
//! The underlying transport can either be of packet type (implementing [Sink] and [Stream])
//! or a socket-like object (implementing [AsyncRead] and [AsyncWrite]).
//! In both cases it must be ordered and reliable.
//! That means that all packets must arrive in the order they have been sent
//! and no packets must be lost.
//! The maximum packet size can be limited, see [the configuration](Cfg) for that.
//!
//! [TCP] is an example of an underlying transport that is suitable.
//! But there are many more candidates, for example, [UNIX domain sockets],
//! [pipes between processes], [serial links], [Bluetooth L2CAP streams], etc.
//!
//! The [connect functions](Connect) are used to establish a
//! [base channel connection](rch::base) over a physical transport.
//! Then, additional channels can be opened by sending either the sender or receiver
//! half of them over the established base channel or another connected channel.
//! See the examples in the [remote channel module](rch) for details.
//!
//! [Sink]: futures::Sink
//! [Stream]: futures::Stream
//! [AsyncRead]: tokio::io::AsyncRead
//! [AsyncWrite]: tokio::io::AsyncWrite

//! # Crate features
//!
//! The modules of Remoc are gated by crate features, as shown below.
//! For ease of use all features are enabled by default.
//! See the [codec module](codec) documentation on how to select a default codec.
//! The `full` feature enables all functionality but does not include a default codec.
