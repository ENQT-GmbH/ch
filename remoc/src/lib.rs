//! ReMOCüêô ‚Äî Remote multiplexed objects and channels
//!
//! ## Transport constraints
//!
//! Both [connect_framed] and [connect_io] spawn the channel multiplexer onto a separate task and
//! thus the transport must have static lifetime and be [Send] and [Sync].
//! To avoid this, you can create and run the channel multiplexer manually.
//! To do so, instance [ChMux](chmux::ChMux) directly and invoke [remote::connect](rsync::remote::connect)
//! to create the initial channel.
