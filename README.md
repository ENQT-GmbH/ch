# Remoc-obs â€” remotely observable collections for use with [Remoc]

This crate provides collections that emit an event for each change.
This event stream can be sent to a remote endpoint via a [Remoc] channel,
where a mirrored collection can be built from it.

At the moment the following is implemented:
  * a remotely observable hash map
  * a channel buffer that stores and replays all values sent through it
